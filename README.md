# Character Creator Editor

The character Creator Editor tool provides a convenient way to create, edit, and scan characters for a character store. </br>

In addition to its powerful creation and editing features, it also includes an mobile optimization that allows users to optimize their character models for low-end devices. 

The character Creator tool consists of 3 sections.

### Create Character:
* With the Create Character feature, users can easily create a new character by entering a name, price, and selecting a prefab or fbx file from the computer or in the project. </br>
* Users can also configure additional settings, including Animator and Colliders. </br>
* Users can automatically generate an icon from the selected prefab and save it to the project. </br>
* Users can optimize their character models for low-end devices by simply toggling the "Optimize For Mobile" button.

### Edit Character:
* The Edit Character feature allows users to edit existing characters, without making any changes to the main store scriptable object until the save button is clicked. </br>
* Users can also remove selected characters.  </br>

### Scan Project:
* The Scan Project feature enables users to scan the project for unused prefabs that can be added to the store.  </br>
* Clicking on the "Create" button in this section opens the Create Character section with the selected unused prefab. </br>
